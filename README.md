### BearPolar

BearPolar is an app that helps sufferers of bipolar disorder types 1 and 2 and sufferers of clinical depression manage and monitor their illness.

I suffer from Bipolar 1 and consequently have an enormous amount of medication to manage on a daily basis. I often find I miss dosages of various medications or take them late. I bemaon the lack of a decent application that will not only track the medication I have to take, but when, **IF** I have, and after some reasonable amount of time, nag me via notification, until I do swallow the damn pills. I'd also like the app to track my moods, so I can see if there are any patterns and correlations, and I'd like to be able to share my information ***securely*** with selected caregivers on a retractable basis, i.e. I like shated data to be ephemersal from the receivers' point of view.

For this reason I envision Bear Polar as an open source project that anyone, bipilar or not may work on and learn while doing so. I have plenty of ideas about how to give the app some more useful, programatically challenging and yet useful functionality that will exercise iOS ( initially - Android to come if we have any uptake ) to it's limits.

The the pun on Bipolar is obvious in the name, what may not be obvious is that the livid green color scheme is drawn from the bipolar ribbon.
